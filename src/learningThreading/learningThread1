constructors cannot be synchronized

*synchronized methods eg public syncronized void help();


*Synchronized Statements

Another way to create synchronized code is with synchronized statements. Unlike synchronized methods, synchronized statements must specify the object that provides the intrinsic lock:

public void addName(String name) {
    synchronized(this) {
        lastName = name;
        nameCount++;
    }
    nameList.add(name);
}

*to make the changes made to a field appear to all the fields make that field volatile.

*to use wait and notify methods of an object you have to acquire a lock
    on that objects monitor through synchronized

eg      synchronized(object);

after this u can use wait and notify methods of object

eg object.wait object.notify
