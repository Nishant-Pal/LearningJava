The  differences are

* 
 static methods and static data elements can only be accessed inside a static method like 
public static void main(Sting[] args)

* if method or data element are to be accessed by obect of a class 
no need to declare it static .Even if they are private or protected

*if methods or data elements are to be accessed in a static method of the same class declare
them static .

*static means only on copy, final means value will not change.

* When declaring class variables as public static final, then variable 
  names (constants) are all in upper case. If the static variables are
  not public and final,the naming syntax is the same as instance and
  local variables.
