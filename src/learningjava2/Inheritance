SuperClass s=new SubClass()

here s is a reference variable whose data type cannot be changed
it can be only be instantiated

The reference variable can be reassigned to other objects provided that it is not declared final. 
The type of the reference variable would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object.

Types of inheritance

1) Single level

2)Multilevel

3)A very important fact to remember is that Java does not support multiple inheritance. 
    This means that a class cannot extend more than one class. Therefore following 
is illegal âˆ’ 
public class extends Animal, Mammal{}   
However, a class can implement one or more interfaces,
 which has helped Java get rid of the impossibility of multiple inheritance. 

*A class can implement multiple interfaces

*an interface can extend multiple interfaces

4)Hierarchial inheritance
